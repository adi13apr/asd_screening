    "clinical_support_explanation": "1. The EEG screening results showing atypical frontal and temporal neural signal patterns are congruent with the literature suggesting variability in brain function among individuals on the autism spectrum, as documented by Leitner (2014) who found elevated ASD traits alongside neurological differences. This is not a diagnosis but highlights atypical findings that may warrant further comprehensive evaluation for an accurate assessment of potential developmental concerns in children with autism spectrum disorder, as recommended by the CDC (2020).\n\n\nThe mild reduction observed in visual attention patterns aligns with reports from Stewart et al. (2016), who discovered heightened ASD traits within children diagnosed with OCD and possible overlaps that could suggest comorbid conditions affecting sensory processing or attentional systems. This screening result, while not a definitive indicator of any disorder, indicates an area where the child may require additional attention in comprehensive evaluations for ASD symptoms as part of developmental surveillance and early identification strategies advocated by Leitner et al. (2014).\n\n\nMotor gesture patterns within expected screening range are consistent with typical neurodevelopment, suggesting no immediate cause for concern regarding motor functions during the initial screening phase. This is in line with normative developmental milestones and does not suggest abnormalities as per common autism spectrum disorder associations between gross motor skills delays or impairments and ASD diagnoses (Leitner Y, 2014).\n\n\nThe difficulty in consistently detecting the child's face reliably during screening may reflect challenges related to visual processing which can sometimes be present in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. This is a common area of concern and investigation within initial assessments for ASD, where facial recognition difficulties have been associated as one aspect that differentiates typical development from potential atypical patterns seen in the early stages (Leitner Y et al., 2014).\n\n\nIt's important to note these findings are not diagnostic but serve a crucial role in guiding further comprehensive evaluations. The source of this information is found within clinical guidance and research on autism spectrum disorders provided by Fuentes & Escapprapacietg (2020), which emphasizes the use of multiple screening tools for early detection rather than relying solely on a single measure, as no singular indicator can be recommended across all cases.\n\n(CDC - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)",
